# Koch-Snowflake
## 1. Define the equalaterial triangle use three points to represent the triangle's vertices, and store these in an array.

## 2. Implement a Recursive Function by writing a function to draw a single Koch curve segment between two points. The function divide the line into three equal parts and replace the middle third with a "peak" that forms a smaller equilateral triangle.Then recursively apply the same process to each resulting segment
## 3. Do the same for Loop each side of the triangle and apply the recursive function to generate Koch curves for each side. This will create the snowflake shape.
